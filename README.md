# Language Translator Using Seq2Seq Model RNN


# About 

Language Translator using Seq2Seq Model(RNN)

Used : Python, Keras

Design Implementation and Prototyping

Build and devise a high performing machine translation sequence to sequence model(RNN) that will accept English text as input and return the French translation

• Supervised model development, processing of text data to feed it to the network pipelines, testing and validation of translated output text streams.


• Developed a Recurrent Neural Network and fully-connected layer to accept and process the sequence of words respectively.

# Prerequiste :

Below software shall be installed

Anaconda --> It shall have Jupyter Notebook
Steps : (After having the Prerequiste installed)

Clone repository. Use below https link https://github.com/ShrishailyaChavan/Language_Translator_Using_Seq2Seq_Model_RNN.git
